## Introduction

A `zipper` connects (or zips together) a continuous flow of data generated by `source` and [stream functions](/stream-fn) that operate on the data stream.
To define a workflow configuration for `zipper`, you can simply create a `.yaml` file (see the example below).

YoMo uses the [QUIC transport protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC),
which largely improves the speed of data transfer,
and supports the encoding/decoding of streams that have different data types through the [y3 codec](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec-golang).

## Configure and Run `zipper`

### `workflow.yaml`

You can define a workflow configuration for `zipper` in a `.yaml` file.
For example, here is the workflow of a simple real-time noise monitoring system:

```yaml
# zipper/workflow.yaml
name: Service
host: localhost
port: 9000
functions:
  - name: Noise
  - name: MockDB
```

- `name`: Name of the `zipper`.
- `host` and `port`: `zipper` will be listening on `host:port`.
- `functions`: A list of stream functions. In this example, `Noise` will monitor changes in the noise level and print out a warning message when it reaches a certain threshold. `MockDB` will save the data to a database.

### Running the [Sample Program](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/tree/next/example/basic)

#### 1. Install YoMo CLI

Please refer to the instructions [here](/).

#### 2. Start `zipper`

```bash
yomo serve -c ./zipper/workflow.yaml

ℹ️   Found 1 stream functions in zipper config
ℹ️   Stream Function 1: Noise
ℹ️   Running YoMo Zipper...
```

#### 3. Start `stream-fn`

```bash
yomo run ./stream-fn/app.go -n Noise

ℹ️  YoMo Stream Function file: example/basic/stream-fn/app.go
⌛  Create YoMo Stream Function instance...
ℹ️  Starting YoMo Stream Function instance with Name: Noise. Host: localhost. Port: 9000.
⌛  YoMo Stream Function building...
✅  Success! YoMo Stream Function build.
ℹ️  YoMo Stream Function is running...
2021/05/20 14:10:17 ✅ Connected to zipper localhost:9000
2021/05/20 14:10:17 Running the Stream Function.
```

#### 4. Start `stream-fn-db`

```bash
go run ./stream-fn-db/app.go -n MockDB

2021/05/20 14:10:29 ✅ Connected to zipper localhost:9000
2021/05/20 14:10:29 Running the Serverless Function.
```

#### 5. Start `source`

```bash
go run ./source/main.go

2021/05/20 14:11:00 Connecting to zipper localhost:9000 ...
2021/05/20 14:11:00 ✅ Connected to zipper localhost:9000
2021/05/20 14:11:00 ✅ Emit {99.11785 1621491060031 localhost} to zipper
2021/05/20 14:11:00 ✅ Emit {145.5075 1621491060131 localhost} to zipper
2021/05/20 14:11:00 ✅ Emit {118.27067 1621491060233 localhost} to zipper
2021/05/20 14:11:00 ✅ Emit {56.369446 1621491060335 localhost} to zipper
```

#### 6. Results

`stream-fn` (i.e., `Noise`) monitors changes in the noise level and prints out a warning message when it reaches a certain threshold:

```bash
[localhost] 1621491060839 > value: 15.714272 ⚡️=1ms
[localhost] 1621491060942 > value: 14.961421 ⚡️=1ms
[localhost] 1621491061043 > value: 18.712460 ⚡️=1ms
❗ value: 18.712460 reaches the threshold 16! 𝚫=2.712460
[localhost] 1621491061146 > value: 1.071311 ⚡️=1ms
[localhost] 1621491061246 > value: 16.458117 ⚡️=1ms
❗ value: 16.458117 reaches the threshold 16! 𝚫=0.458117
🧩 average value in last 10000 ms: 10.918112!
```

`stream-fn-db` (i.e., `MockDB`) saves data to FaunaDB:

```bash
save `18.71246` to FaunaDB
save `1.0713108` to FaunaDB
save `16.458117` to FaunaDB
save `12.397432` to FaunaDB
save `15.227814` to FaunaDB
save `14.787642` to FaunaDB
save `17.85902` to FaunaDB
```
